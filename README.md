# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, as described in the paper ["Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602) by V. Mnih et al.


## Overview

The Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks to enable an agent to learn optimal policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs. This implementation focuses on training the agent in an Atari environment.

## Features

- Implementation of the DQN algorithm.
- Preprocessing of input frames (grayscale conversion, frame stacking, etc.).
- Experience replay to stabilize training.
- Target network to reduce correlations during training.
- Environment setup using OpenAI's Gym.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and ensure you have the required packages installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DQN-Implementation.git
cd DQN-Implementation
```
## Usage

Usage
To run the implementation, simply open the notebook and execute the cells in order:

```bash
jupyter notebook DQN_Implementation.ipynb
```
